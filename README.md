# ModelSolarSystem

Introductory graphics project using WebGL modeling a simple solar system with one sun, four orbiting planets, and a small moon orbiting the fourth planet.

To run the project, locate the SolarSystem.html file in the Project folder and open it using either Google Chrome, Firefox, or
Internet Explorer.

## Controls
W           - move forward

S           - move backwards

A           - move left

D           - move right

UP_ARROW    - move up

DOWN_ARROW  - move down

LEFT_ARROW  - rotate left

RIGHT_ARROW - rotate right

R           - reset view

F           - attach to/detach from the green (2nd) planet

Q           - make horizontal FOV narrower

E           - make horizontal FOV wider

While attached to the 2nd planet, the user can look around using the left and right arrow keys.

## Details
- A point light source is located at the sun.

- The sun is Phong shaded and made to look like it is flickering.

- The first planet is a low complexity, flat shaded sphere made to look icy white, faceted, and diamond-like.

- The second planet is a medium complexity, Gouraud shaded sphere made to look green and swampy.

- The third planet is a high complexity, Phong shaded sphere with a specular highlight made to look smooth and
covered in water.

- The fourth planet is a medium complexity, Gouraud shaded sphere made to look dull, brownish-orange, and mud-covered.
Orbiting around it is a small shiny red moon.
